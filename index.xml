      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my next try to start a blog. Previous one was nearly two years ago. It is interesting to see how fast technology is evolving. Hugo - the tool I am planning to use now - wasn&amp;rsquo;t even in a stable state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo is a simple static site generator - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any dependencies to run. The older site generators had tons of dependencies - language, runtime, a couple of libraries, plugins etc. They often had caveats with some platforms(windows, usually) and occasional version conflicts.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad for a person with software development experience, but if you compare it to a single executable file that is Hugo - difference is dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it took me about 20 minutes to set up Hugo site and it took me a several hours with an older technology. So if you want to use a static site generator - you should give Hugo a try.&lt;/p&gt;
