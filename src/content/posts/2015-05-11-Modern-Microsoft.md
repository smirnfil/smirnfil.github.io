### Intro

I've been writing C# since Visual Studio 2005. I'm not the most experienced C# developer in the world, but I used C#/.Net a lot. It is very
interesting to compare the old ways and new ways in C# development. 

C# started as a copy of Java - C-syntax language with garbage collection. And even with all the changes in both Java World and .Net World they still look very
similliar - it isn't hard to write a piece of code that will look exactly the same in both languages. The main difference lies not in the syntax but in the libraries.

It is very common misconcept that language defines the program. JavaScript is the best contrexample - it got one small update during last 16 years. However,
the difference between things you could wrote in JS 5 years ago and things you could write in JS now is astonishing. Libraries and tools are the things that are crucial
for development, not the language(by the way, many libraries and tools are reimplemented in other languages). 

So, let's speak about changes in different areas of development. I like to separate all C# development in three huge domains - desktop development, web development 
and mobile development. Let's talk about each of them.

### Desktop

Desktop is dying. These process will take years (for example, mainframes that "died out" in 90s are still used in many areas) but it's inevitable. You don't want an 
application you use to be available only on your desktop - you want it everywhere. That's the reason why Microsoft doesn't focus on desktop development anymore - they have
really nice tools like WPF which do their work. But the future of desktop development is multiplatform development. We have third-party tools like Unity Engine that use C#
as scripting tool, Xamarin which now deploys to windows 8(more about Xamarin in mobile section). Also Microsoft recently announced Universal apps that will deploy on all
MS powered devices.
